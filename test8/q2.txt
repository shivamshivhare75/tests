we can loop an array in three ways:

const a =[1,2,3,4];

1- traditional for loop :-   (in this loop we get the index of the element).

for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){ 
    console.log(i);
}

2- for of loop :-  (in this loop we get the element).

for(let i of arr){
    console.log(i);
}  

3- for in loop :-  (in this loop we get the index of the element).

for(let i in arr){
     console.log(i);
}

4. while loop :-
let i = 0;
while (i<a.length){
    console.log(a[i]);
    i++
}


The commonly used for loop is the for of loop and traditional for loop.
